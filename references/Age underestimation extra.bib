  abstract = {Age and growth estimates for the blue shark (Prionace glauca) were derived from 411 vertebral centra and 43 tag-recaptured blue sharks collected in the North Atlantic, ranging in length from 49 to 312 em fork length (FL). The vertebrae of two oxytetracycline-injected recaptured blue sharks support an annual spring deposition of growth bands in the vertebrae in sharks up to 192 cm FL. Males and females were aged to 16 and 15 years, respectively, and full maturity is attained by 5 years of age in both sexes. Both sexes grew similarly to age seven, when growth rates decreased in males and remained constant in females. Growth rates from tag-recaptured individuals agreed with those derived from vertebral annuli for smaller sharks but appeared overestimated for larger sharks. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters derived from vertebral length-at-age data are L-x = 282 cm FL, K = 0.18, and t(0) = -1.35 for males, and L-x = 310 em FL, K = 0.13, and t(0) = -1.77 for females. The species grows faster and has a shorter life span than previously reported for these waters.},

Tetracycline-injected sharks held in captivity and, to a lesser extent, tagged, released and recaptured, were utilized for validating the annual nature of the rings (herein defined as the narrow, translucent regions) appearing on vertebral centra. The technique was validated for all age groups (0 to 6 + yr) included in the study. Marginal increment analysis likewise suggested annual ring formation. The rings formed during the winter, when water temperatures were lowest. Using the vertebral ring aging-technique, von Bertalanffy growth curves for males and females from both Tampa and Florida Bays were constructed. Growth of sharks born and held in captivity demonstrated that the male and female growth curves diverge after approximately 1 yr and that mean sizes at age are statistically distinct after approximately 2 yr. In both populations, females grew to larger sizes than males and apparently are longer-lived. Reproductively mature females from Tampa Bay were significantly larger than those from Florida Bay.},

Vertebral growth bands provide an accurate indicator of age in young porbeagle, but age validation has never been reported for any large shark species past the age of sexual maturity. Here, we report the first application of bomb radiocarbon as an age validation method for long-lived sharks based on date-specific incorporation of radiocarbon into vertebral growth bands. Our results indicate that porbeagle vertebrae recorded and preserved a bomb radiocarbon pulse in growth bands formed during the 1960s. Through comparison of radiocarbon assays in young, known-age porbeagle collected in the 1960s with the corresponding growth bands in old porbeagle collected later, we confirm the validity of porbeagle vertebral growth band counts as accurate annual age indicators to an age of at least 26 years. The radiocarbon signatures of porbeagle vertebral growth bands appear to be temporally and metabolically stable and derived mainly from the radiocarbon content of their prey. Preliminary radiocarbon assays of shortfin mako vertebrae suggest that current methods for determining shortfin mako age are incorrect.},

The oldest animal aged was a 32-year-old female 274 cm in length. Growth-rate estimates based on vertebral ageing for animals up to 5 years of age are similar to those from tag-recapture studies on the same population.

C. sorrah grew to adult size relatively fast, reaching maturity at 2.3\textendash{}2.4 years, whereas C. tilstoni grew slower, reaching maturity at 5.2\textendash{}6.1 years. For both species, however, reproduction did not commence until approximately a year after maturity, at 3.4 years for C. sorrah and 7.2 years for C. tilstoni. The results of the present study suggest that in the GBRWHA, C. tilstoni, in particular, begins reproducing at an older age and lives longer than previously thought.},

Age and growth estimates were derived from band counts of 238-sectioned vertebral centra. Bomb radiocarbon analysis of ten band pairs extracted from four vertebral sections suggested that band pairs are deposited annually up to age 20. Males and females were aged to 20 and 22\&nbsp;years, respectively, although longevity estimates predict maximum ages of 27 and 29\&nbsp;years, respectively. Two- and three-parameter von Bertalanffy and Gompertz growth functions fit to length at age data demonstrated that growth rates were similar for males and females up to around 200\&nbsp;cm fork length (FL) after which male growth slowed. Both sexes appear to reach maturity at age 10. The two-parameter von Bertalanffy growth function provided the best biological fit to length at age data generating parameter estimates of: L $\infty$ \&nbsp;=\&nbsp;330\&nbsp;cm FL, k\&nbsp;=\&nbsp;0.131 for males and L $\infty$ \&nbsp;=\&nbsp;347\&nbsp;cm FL, k\&nbsp;=\&nbsp;0.124 for females, with L 0 set at 62\&nbsp;cm FL.

The vertebrae of 41 females (41-181 cm precaudal length [PCL]) and 51 males (42-182 cm PCL) were examined. Three methods successfully enhanced the visibility of growth rings: crystal violet staining of the centrum face, microscopic examination of the whole vertebra, with transmitted light and dark field, and ''bow tie'' sectioning of the vertebra. The results of the three methods were compared by using the average percentage error index and statistical means. Age and growth estimates were obtained from microscopic examination of the whole vertebra, the method which provided the most accurate ring counts and gave the second highest reproducibility. The data for males and females were combined and the von Bertalanffy parameters obtained were L(infinity) = 193.6 cm PCL, K = 0.21 yr(-1) and t(o) = -1.2 yr. Age at maturity was 7 years (156 cm PCL) for females and 6 years (150 cm PCL) for males. The oldest aged female was 11 years (179 cm PCL), the oldest aged male was 10 years (179 cm PCL) old. Mean calculated growth rates were 24 cm/yr for the first three years, 11-13 cm/yr through adolescence, and 5-6 cm/yr after maturity. Back-calculated lengths were lower than observed lengths and Lee's phenomenon was apparent. In 83\% of the vertebrae the band immediately after the change in angle was translucent.

Estimates of the onset of maturity based on ovary condition were 729 mm, 1117 mm, and 1591 mm total length ( TL) for O. ornatus, O. maculatus and O. halei respectively. The length at which 50\% of the male population is mature based on clasper calcification was 803 mm, 1282 mm and 1784 mm TL for O. ornatus, O. maculatus and O. halei, respectively, and was similar to female onset of maturity based on uterus condition and to TL-at-maternity. These species of wobbegong had synchronous, triennial reproductive cycles. Follicles took 2 years to enlarge before ovulation. During the first year, follicles remained small, and then grew rapidly during the second year before ovulation during November. Gestation lasted similar to 10-11 months and parturition occurred during September -October. Mean litter sizes were nine ( s.e. 0.5) and 21 ( s.e. 1.5) for O. ornatus and O. maculatus, respectively, and increased with female total length in O. ornatus. Pregnant O. ornatus and O. maculatus were frequently caught in northern NSW and no pregnant wobbegongs, or females with large, yolky follicles were captured south of Sydney. Differences in the reproductive conditions of wobbegongs caught in northern and central NSW suggested geographically dependent reproductive behaviour. Knowledge of the reproductive parameters provided in this paper is necessary for adequate fisheries management and species conservation assessments.},

Two fluorochrome marker dyes, calcein and oxytetracycline, were used to validate the timing and periodicity of vertebral band formation in nine individuals held in the laboratory for between 423 and 472 days. Growth bands were difficult to interpret and final counts were obtained from only 98 (53.8\%) individuals ranging in total length (TL) from 63 to 146 cm. The timing of growth band formation in the vertebrae of captive animals had no predictable temporal pattern, with formation occurring during all seasons of the year, making age validation difficult. Growth band formation was hypothesised to be influenced by non-periodic changes in centrum or somatic growth rather than seasonal growth, as observed in many other elasmobranch species. Growth rates of nine O. hutchinsi held in captivity varied considerably, ranging from 3.5 cm year{\^a}\texteuro``1 to 13.8 cm year{\^a}\texteuro``1 in total length (mean = 7.03 cm year{\^a}\texteuro``1). Although the periodicity of vertebral band formation in captive animals did not support a synchronous annual pattern, captive growth rates matched those predicted when an annual band pattern was assumed for wild caught individuals. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters estimated from vertebral analysis assuming an annual banding pattern and a mean size of birth of 24.1 cm were: L{\^a}ˆ{\v z} = 149.45 cm and K = 0.117 year{\^a}\texteuro``1 for both sexes combined. These results illustrate the fundamental importance of validating the periodicity of growth band formation in elasmobranch age and growth studies as it has considerable implications for the management of fisheries that exploit shark and ray species that may exhibit asynchronous growth band deposition.},

  abstract = {The subjective interpretation of the growth increments in shark vertebrae and uncertainty over the temporal periodicity of their formation decrease confidence in the accuracy of ages estimated from increment counts. To determine the periodicity with which growth increments are formed in the vertebrae of gummy shark, Mustelus antarcticus, fluorochrome dyes were injected into captive sharks at quarterly intervals. Variation in the vertebral growth rate between fluorochrome labels was examined and compared with measurements of the density of mineralisation of vertebral sections. The slowest rates of vertebral growth and the highest radiographic densities were found in the vertebral tissues formed during winter. The microradiographic method described here resolves individual hypermineralised increments that are indistinguishable using surface reading methods. With this extra information, a reader may better count, group, or exclude certain growth increment patterns when making an age estimation. Counts of clusters of hypermineralised increments may be more useful in age determination than counts of individual increments because individual increments form unpredictably and possibly result from brief, irregular episodes of slow vertebral growth.},

  abstract = {Recent declines in abundance of skates off the eastern coast of Canada have heightened the need for validated age and growth estimates in the region. In all, 502 winter (Leucoraja ocellata), little (Leucoraja erinacea), thorny (Amblyraja radiata), and smooth (Malacoraja senta) skate vertebral centra collected seasonally between 1999 and 2004 were sectioned using a mass processing method, then used to reconstruct growth in each species. Bomb rediocarbon (Delta C-14) analysis was used to provide evidence of annual band-pair deposition in thorny skates. Estimates of L-infinity from traditional von Bertalanffy growth models (VBGM) ranged from 60.6 cm (little skate) to 89.7 cm (thorny skate), and K estimates from 0.07 (thorny skate) to 0.19 (little skate). A modified two-parameter VBGM (L-MAX = 94.1 cm) fitted to winter skate lenght-at-age data yielded a value of K to 0.15. Maximum observed ages ranged from 12 (little skate) to 19 years in both winter and thorny skates. The year-specific incorporation of Delta C-14 milled from thorny and winter skate vertebral sections closely resembled shark-derived reference chronology values from the Northwest Atlantic. Pre-bomb Delta C-14 in a thorny skate collected in 1988 and aged at 23 years appeared to validate age interpretations and suggested that thorny skate reach an absolute age of at least 28 years, the oldest validated age reported for any species of batoid.},

  abstract = {The sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus)was the cornerstone species of western North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico large coastal shark fisheries until 2008 when they were allocated to a research-only fishery. Despite decades of fishing on this species, important life history parameters, such as age and growth, have not been well known. Some validated age and growth information exists for sandbar shark, but more comprehensive life history information is needed. The complementary application of bomb radiocarbon and tag-recapture dating was used in this study to determine valid age-estimation criteria and longevity estimates for this species. These two methods indicated that current age interpretations based on counts of growth bands in vertebrae are accurate to 10 or 12 years. Beyond these years, we could not determine with certainty when such an underestimation of age begins; however, bomb radiocarbon and tag-recapture data indicated that large adult sharks were considerably older than the estimates derived from counts of growth bands. Three adult sandbar sharks were 20 to 26 years old based on bomb radiocarbon results and were a 5- to 11-year increase over the previous age estimates for these sharks. In support of these findings, the tag-recapture data provided results that were consistent with bomb radiocarbon dating and further supported a longevity that exceeds 30 years for this species.},

The data were fitted to the von Bertalanffy growth equation after adopting the Francis reparametrization and correcting for sampling bias caused by the selectivity effects of the gill-nets of various mesh sizes used to capture the sharks. The von Bertalanffy growth curves of male and female gummy shark were significantly different, but the growth curves of male and female school shark were not. The growth curves suggest that growth rates of male and female gummy shark in Bass Strait were lower during 1986-87 than during 1973-76 and that the growth rates of male and female gummy shark and school shark in Bass Strait during 1986-87 were lower than those in South Australia at the same time. These apparent temporal and spatial differences in growth patterns of gummy shark are explained by the 'Phenomenon of Apparent Change in Growth Rate'. It is concluded that the growth curves determined for 1986-87 are distorted by the effects of a long history of high and length-selective fishing mortality and that actual growth patterns of gummy shark are better represented by the von Bertalanffy growth equation determined for shark caught in Bass Strait during 1973-76, when fishing mortality was much lower. Verification of age estimates was attempted by comparing von Bertalanffy growth curves derived from age-length data with those derived from tag release-recapture length-increment data, but these comparisons highlight the limitations of using tag data for this purpose. Although reasonable agreement was found between such growth curves for gummy shark, it appears that school shark older than 11 years cannot be aged accurately from stained whole or sectioned vertebrae. Sectioned vertebrae from a school shark recaptured 35.7 years after being tagged and released and calculated as having an age exceeding 45 years gave estimates of only 18-20 years of age.},

  abstract = {Age and growth parameters were derived for blue-spotted maskray Neotrygon kuhlii from Moreton Bay in subtropical eastern Australia. Maximum age estimates of 13 and 10 years were obtained from female (n = 76) and male (n = 44) N. kuhlii, respectively. Estimated ages at maturity for 50\% of females and males were 6.32 and 3.95 years, respectively. A three-parameter power function provided the best statistical fit to size at age data in both sexes, providing parameter estimates of y(0) = 163.13, a = 58.52 and b = 0.58 for females and y(0) = 165.13, a = 59.02 and b = 0.54 in males. The two-parameter von Bertalanffy growth function was used to estimate biological parameters based on disc width (W-D) for both female (W-D infinity = 465.81 mm, K = 0.13 year(-1), b = 0.63) and male N. kuhlii (W-D infinity = 385.19 mm, K = 0.20 year(-1), b = 0.54). Annual band-pair deposition was observed in three calcein-injected N. kuhlii after periods of liberty ranging from 631 to 1081 days. Centrum edge analysis indicated that annual band-pair formation was generally consistent within this population, with translucent bands formed over spring and summer and opaque bands formed in autumn and winter. Individual growth rates obtained from tagged specimens were similar to power function growth predictions. These results support previous characterizations of this common trawl by-catch species as comparatively resilient to non-targeted catches, although higher catch rates outside Australia infer a need for cautious management.

  abstract = {Preliminary validation of annual growth band deposition in vertebrae of great hammerhead shark (Sphyrna mokarran) was conducted by using bomb radiocarbon analysis. Adult specimens (n=2) were collected and thin sections of vertebral centra were removed for visual aging and use in radiocarbon assays. Vertebral band counts were used to estimate age, and year of formation was assigned to each growth band by subtracting estimated age from the year of capture. A total of 10 samples were extracted from growth bands and analyzed for Delta C-14. Calculated Delta C-14 values from dated bands were compared to known-age reference chronologies, and the resulting patterns indicated annual periodicity of growth bands up to a minimum age of 42 years. Trends in Delta C-14 across time in individual specimens indicated that vertebral radiocarbon is conserved through time but that habitat and diet may influence Delta C-14 levels in elasmobranchs. Although the age validation reported here must be considered preliminary because of the small sample size and narrow age range of individuals sampled, it represents the first confirmation of age in S. mokarran, further illustrating the usefulness of bomb radiocarbon analysis as a tool for life history studies in elasmobranchs.},

The oldest female and male sand tiger sharks aged in this study were 17 and 15 years of age, respectively. von Bertalanffy growth parameters derived from vertebral length-at-age data are L-infinity = 295.8 cm TL, k = 0.11 year(-1), and t(0) = -4.2 years for females, and L-infinity = 249.5 cm TL, k = 0.16 year(-1), and t(0) = -3.4 years for males. Sexual maturity is estimated to be 9-10 years for females and 6-7 years for males. Weight-to-length relationships determined for female and male sand tiger sharks in the western North Atlantic are; W = 1.3 x 10(-4) x L-2.4 (r(2) = 0.84, n = 55) and W = 9.0 x 10(-5) x L-2.5 (r(2) = 0.84, n = 47), respectively, and 7.9 x 10-(5-) x L-2.5 (r(2) = 0.84) for the sexes combined. Our results show sand tigers possess a slower rate of growth than previously thought. This information is crucial for accurately assessing this population's ability to recover, and further justifies the need for this species to be fully protected.},

  abstract = {Age estimation is an issue for the shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrinchus, because of disagreement on vertebral band-pair deposition periodicity. In the 1950s--1960s, thermonuclear testing released large amounts of radiocarbon into the atmosphere, which diffused into the ocean through gas exchange. This influx created a time-specific marker that can be used in age validation. Annual band-pair deposition in the porbeagle, Lamna nasus, was validated in a previous study and indicated preliminary annual deposition in the shortfin mako, using four samples from one vertebra. In the present study, age estimates from 54 shortfin mako vertebrae collected in 1950--1984 ranged 1--31~years. Ageing error between readers was consistent, with 76\% of the estimates ranging within 2~years. Twenty-one $\Delta$14C values from eight shortfin mako vertebrae (collected in the western North Atlantic in 1963--1984) ranged -154.8texttenthousand to 86.8texttenthousand. The resulting conformity with the $\Delta$14C timeline for the porbeagle supported annual band-pair deposition in vertebrae of the shortfin mako.},

  abstract = {Bomb radiocarbon dating was used to determine the periodicity of band pair formation in the vertebral centra of three common thresher sharks (Alopias vulpinus). The traditional interpretation of band pairs were accurate (i.e. annual) up to approximately 14 years of age. In older individuals, band pair counts underestimated age. A new maximum validated age was estimated to be 38 years (an increase of 18 years over the band count estimates). Previously reported length at age estimates for common thresher sharks up to 14 years were used in conjunction with the two older validated estimates to develop a revised growth curve for the species, which was described using the Schnute general model (sexes combined). Updated estimates of age at maturity remained the same for males (8 years) and increased by one year to 13 years for females. The primary finding was the increase in longevity for this species from a band pair count estimate of 24 years to a bomb radiocarbon validated estimate of 38 years, indicating this species lives much longer than previously thought.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of age and growth parameters is vital to the conservation and management of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), but ages have not been validated for all populations and growth rates can vary regionally. Bomb radiocarbon (14C) analyses conducted on four individual white sharks [329, 414, 487, and 537~cm fork length (FL)] from the southwest Indian Ocean (SWI) were proximally aligned with $\Delta$14C reference chronologies accepting established error, providing evidence to support annual band pair formation to 30--38~years for the SWI population. To enable comparison with previous studies on bomb radiocarbon in white sharks, a subset of specimens from the northwest Atlantic Ocean (NWA; 223.5, 441, and 493~cm FL) and northeast Pacific Ocean (NEP; 214, 365, and 429~cm FL) were also analyzed for 14C, revealing samples from the SWI were more enriched in 14C than samples from the NWA or NEP. Vertebral band pair counts were then determined for a larger set of white sharks from the SWI (140--422~cm FL, n~=~51) resulting in age ranges of 1--38~years. The Gompertz growth model best described the SWI data, with an asymptotic size (L $\infty$ ) of 496.77~cm FL and length at birth (L 0) of 134.08~cm FL. The results of this study indicate white sharks in the SWI are longer-lived and grow more slowly compared to past estimates, but these data are more similar to recent age and growth estimates from other geographically distinct populations. This has important implications for the management of this species in the waters off southern Africa.},

  volume = {41},
  doi = {10.1093/icesjms/41.2.111},
  abstract = {Growth and population dynamics have been studied in a mixed population ofRaja clavata, R. microocellata, and R. montagui in Carmarthen Bay, South Wales, from 1974 to 1976. All, but especially the first two species, are fished commercially. An improved method for displaying the annuli in vertebrae is described, and all the data obtained are based on fish of established age. The maturation stages of the ovary and a previously unreported seasonal cycle of development and regression of mixopterygia (claspers) are described. For R. clavata, R. microocellata, and R. montagui respectively the maximum age and mean length at that age of trawled fish was 12 years and 1047 mm, 9 years and 875 mm, and 7 years and 710 mm, but older, larger fish were caught by anglers. The values of the von Bertalanffy parameters L $\infty$ and K were 1392 mm and 0$\cdot$090, 1370 mm and 0$\cdot$086, and 978 mm and 0$\cdot$152 respectively. Females grew larger than males. First spawning in all three species occurs mainly in the fifth year. Total mortality based on research vessel catches for the three species was estimated as Z = 0$\cdot$45, 0$\cdot$54, and 0$\cdot$46 respectively, but differences were found between the sexes, Z always being higher in males. For females and males respectively, estimates were Z = 0$\cdot$27 and 0$\cdot$56, 0$\cdot$38 and 0$\cdot$56, and 0$\cdot$48 and 0$\cdot$72. Using the multiple regression devised by Pauly (1980), natural mortality was estimated as M = 0$\cdot$16 in R. clavata and M = 0$\cdot$14 in R. microocellata, hence F = 0$\cdot$29 and 0$\cdot$40 respectively. For the smaller and less exploited R. montagui, M = 0$\cdot$25 and F = 0$\cdot$21. Fecundity in R. clavata and R. microocellata is probably less than 100 eggs annually, the counts indicating minima of 62 to 74 and 54 to 61 eggs respectively. Most of the rays in Carmarthen Bay are young, with fish of age groups 0 to 2 comprising 87 \%, 71 \%, and 92 \% of the analysed catch of R. clavata, R. microocellata, and R. montagui respectively. Rays in the oldest age group of the three species represented by other than an occasional fish had mean measurements of 68 \%, 64 \%, and 73 \% of their L $\infty$ and estimated ages corresponding to 0$\cdot$7 L $\infty$ are 16$\cdot$0, 17$\cdot$0, and 9$\cdot$6 years respectively. The findings are discussed and it is concluded that, while the stock is probably depleted, growth being insufficient to support the present level of exploitation, there should be no danger of recruitment failure so long as Z remains less than about 0$\cdot$7.},
