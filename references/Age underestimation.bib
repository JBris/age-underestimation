  abstract = {Grey nurse sharks off the east coast of Australia are listed nationally as critically endangered under Schedule 1 of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999) and may number no more than 300 in New South Wales and southern Queensland waters. They are an inshore, coastal dwelling species and were severely depleted by spearfishing in the 1960s. The population has continued to decline despite protection since 1984. Their life history (long-lived to 25+ years), late maturation (6-8 years), low fecundity (maximum 2 live young biennially), specific habitat requirements, limited inshore distribution, and small population size render them particularly vulnerable to extinction. We estimated the time to quasi-extinction (years elapsed for the population to consist of less than or equal to50 females) for the grey nurse shark population off the east coast of Australia based on current estimates of abundance and known anthropogenic rates of mortality. Estimated minimum population size was 300 as of 2002, and minimum anthropogenic mortality assessed from recovered carcasses was 12/year of which 75\% were females. We modelled time to quasi-extinction using deterministic age- and stage-classified models for worst-, likely and best-case scenarios. Population size was estimated at 300 (worst), 1000 (likely) and 3000 (best). Anthropogenic mortality was added to the model assuming either all carcasses are being recovered (best), or conservatively, that only 50\% are reported (realistic). Depending on model structure, if all carcasses are being reported, quasi-extinction times for worst-, likely and best-case scenarios range from 13 to 16 years, 84-98 years and 289324 years, respectively. If under-reporting is occurring, time to quasi-extinction ranges from 6 to 8 years, 45-53 years and 173-200 years, respectively. In all scenarios modelled the grey nurse shark population will decline if no further steps are taken to remove anthropogenic sources of mortality. Because estimates of quasi-extinction rate depend on initial population size, and sensitivity analysis revealed that population rate of change was most sensitive to changes in the survival probability of the smallest length classes, obtaining precise estimates of abundance and annual survival of young females is critical.

  abstract = {We compared life-history traits and extinction risk of chondrichthyans (sharks, rays and chimaeras), a group of high conservation concern, from the three major marine habitats (continental shelves, open ocean and deep sea), controlling for phylogenetic correlation. Deep-water chondrichthyans had a higher age at maturity and longevity, and a lower growth completion rate than shallow-water species. The average fishing mortality needed to drive a deep-water chondrichthyan species to extinction (Fextinct) was 38\textendash{}58\% of that estimated for oceanic and continental shelf species, respectively. Mean values of Fextinct were 0.149, 0.250 and 0.368 for deep-water, oceanic and continental shelf species, respectively. Reproductive mode was an important determinant of extinction risk, while body size had a weak effect on extinction risk. As extinction risk was highly correlated with phylogeny, the loss of species will be accompanied by a loss of phylogenetic diversity. Conservation priority should not be restricted to large species, as is usually suggested, since many small species, like those inhabiting the deep ocean, are also highly vulnerable to extinction. Fishing mortality of deep-water chondrichthyans already exploited should be minimized, and new deep-water fisheries affecting chondrichthyans should be prevented.},

The dorsal spines are located on the external surface of the body and are subjected to natural wear and breakage. Two methods have been developed to account for the worn portion of the spine and extrapolate the lost annuli. We compared the performance of these methods using a large data collection assembled from multiple sources, and evaluated their utility for stock assessment and management of the spiny dogfish shark Squalus suckleyi in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. Our results showed that the two methods produced very different age estimates for older fish with worn spines. Both methods raised significant questions about some aspects of the age estimates produced, and further exploration of techniques to account for worn spine annuli is needed. It is therefore important to develop alternative methods for shark age determination, including those using stained vertebrae.},

Vertebral growth bands provide an accurate indicator of age in young porbeagle, but age validation has never been reported for any large shark species past the age of sexual maturity. Here, we report the first application of bomb radiocarbon as an age validation method for long-lived sharks based on date-specific incorporation of radiocarbon into vertebral growth bands. Our results indicate that porbeagle vertebrae recorded and preserved a bomb radiocarbon pulse in growth bands formed during the 1960s. Through comparison of radiocarbon assays in young, known-age porbeagle collected in the 1960s with the corresponding growth bands in old porbeagle collected later, we confirm the validity of porbeagle vertebral growth band counts as accurate annual age indicators to an age of at least 26 years. The radiocarbon signatures of porbeagle vertebral growth bands appear to be temporally and metabolically stable and derived mainly from the radiocarbon content of their prey. Preliminary radiocarbon assays of shortfin mako vertebrae suggest that current methods for determining shortfin mako age are incorrect.},

  abstract = {Management of fisheries around the world is challenged by fishing impacts on habitats, bycatch species, threatened and endangered species, and even associated ecological communities. One response to these other factors has been a call for ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM), which demands consideration of the above non-target interactions. A challenge with implementation of EBFM is the scale and range of issues to be considered, all of which cannot be addressed at the same level of detail as for target species, due to data or time constraints. We developed an approach to progress the EBFM mandate in Australia, using a new ecological risk assessment framework applied to fisheries, termed Ecological Risk Assessment for the Effects of Fishing (ERAEF). Novel features of this framework include its hierarchical structure and its precautionary approach to uncertainty. The amount of information required increases through the hierarchy, and allows application in data-limited situations. The ERAEF framework has been applied to over 30 fisheries in Australia and elsewhere. The efficiencies in application of the hierarchical approach are illustrated by the south-east otter trawl fishery, where following Level 1 assessment of all components, an initial set of 600 species and 158 habitats was reduced to a group of concern of 159 species and 46 habitats using the Level 2 analysis, with the number of species of concern further reduced to 25 following Level 3 analysis. As a result of the assessments in Australia, management actions have been enacted for a range of the high risk species. Overall, the ERAEF approach offers a realistic method to assess ecological risk in an EBFM context, and has applicability in a wide range of fisheries. The interactive and inclusive nature of the approach also has the advantage of bringing stakeholders, scientists and managers together to develop management solutions.

A new maximum validated age was estimated to be 38 years (an increase of 18 years over the band count estimates). Previously reported length at age estimates for common thresher sharks up to 14 years were used in conjunction with the two older validated estimates to develop a revised growth curve for the species, which was described using the Schnute general model (sexes combined). Updated estimates of age at maturity remained the same for males (8 years) and increased by one year to 13 years for females. The primary finding was the increase in longevity for this species from a band pair count estimate of 24 years to a bomb radiocarbon validated estimate of 38 years, indicating this species lives much longer than previously thought.},

The present study describes the quantitative relationships among age, growth and reproductive biology of two commercially exploited sharks from the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), namely, the spot-tail shark, Carcharhinus sorrah (n~=~659) and the Australian blacktip shark, C. tilstoni (n~=~512). Longevity estimates based on vertebral ageing were 9 and 14 years for male and female C. sorrah and 13 and 15 years for C. tilstoni. However, an age-validation study failed to validate annual banding in larger individuals, suggesting that maximum age may be underestimated by vertebrae. C. sorrah grew to adult size relatively fast, reaching maturity at 2.3\textendash{}2.4 years, whereas C. tilstoni grew slower, reaching maturity at 5.2\textendash{}6.1 years. For both species, however, reproduction did not commence until approximately a year after maturity, at 3.4 years for C. sorrah and 7.2 years for C. tilstoni. The results of the present study suggest that in the GBRWHA, C. tilstoni, in particular, begins reproducing at an older age and lives longer than previously thought.},

  abstract = {School shark, Galeorhinus galeus (family Triakidae), are fished commercially throughout New Zealand, and estimates of their growth rate, age at maturity, and longevity are required for fishery management. We aged school shark from X-rays of thin vertebral sections, but many sections were unclear and ageing precision was low. Nevertheless, there was no between-reader bias, and growth curves derived from length-at-age data appear robust. A growth curve was derived independently from length-frequency data for juvenile school shark up to 9 years old and 120 cm long, and it agreed well with the curve derived from length-at-age data. For older sharks, the growth rate is not certain because of small sample sizes and lack of validation of the ages. Growth rate estimates from tag-recapture data suggested faster growth for small sharks and slower growth for large sharks. Based on length-at-age data, males and females grew at about the same rates. Males matured at about 12-17 years and females at about 13-15 years. The oldest shark in our samples was estimated to be 25 years old, but few large sharks were available for ageing so the longevity of New Zealand school shark remains uncertain.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.fishres.2012.07.025},
  abstract = {Limited data, and the requirement to provide science-based advice for exploited populations, have led to the development of statistical methods that combine several sources of information into a single analysis. This approach, ``integrated analysis'', was first formulated by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Contemporary use of integrated analysis involves using all available data, in as raw a form as appropriate, in a single analysis. Analyses that were traditionally carried out independently are now conducted simultaneously through likelihood functions that include multiple data sources. For example, the traditional analysis of converting catch-at-length data into catch-at-age data for use in an age-structured population dynamics models can be avoided by including the basic data used in this conversion, length-frequency and conditional age-at-length data, in the likelihood function. This allows for consistency in assumptions and permits the uncertainty associated with both data sources to be propagated to final model outputs, such as catch limits under harvest control rules. The development of the \{AD\} Model Builder software has greatly facilitated the use of integrated analyses, and there are now several general stock assessment models (e.g., Stock Synthesis) that allow many data types and model assumptions to be analyzed simultaneously. In this paper, we define integrated analysis, describe its history and development, give several examples, and describe the advantages of and problems with integrated analysis.},

  abstract = {Many calcified structures produce periodic growth increments useful for age determination at the annual or daily scale. However, age determination is invariably accompanied by various sources of error, some of which can have a serious effect on age-structured calculations. This review highlights the best available methods for insuring ageing accuracy and quantifying ageing precision, whether in support of large-scale production ageing or a small-scale research project. Included in this review is a critical overview of methods used to initiate and pursue an accurate and controlled ageing program, including (but not limited to) validation of an ageing method. The distinction between validation of absolute age and increment periodicity is emphasized, as is the importance of determining the age of first increment formation. Based on an analysis of 372 papers reporting age validation since 1983, considerable progress has been made in age validation efforts in recent years. Nevertheless, several of the age validation methods which have been used routinely are of dubious value, particularly marginal increment analysis. The two major measures of precision, average percent error and coefficient of variation, are shown to be functionally equivalent, and a conversion factor relating the two is presented. Through use of quality control monitoring, ageing errors are readily detected and quantified reference collections are the key to both quality control and reduction of costs. Although some level of random ageing error is unavoidable, Such error can often be corrected after the fact using statistical ('digital sharpening') methods.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis of the 'Phenomenon of Apparent Change in Growth Rate' caused by length-selective fishing mortality is adopted for explaining observed differences in published von Bertalanffy growth curves for gummy shark (Mustelus antarcticus) determined from length-at-age data. Three independent pieces of evidence are presented in support of this hypothesis to explain the differences in the curves between 1973-76 and 198-87 in Bass Strait and between Bass Strait and South Australia during 1986-87: (1) Mean length of the sharks in each of the ages-classes 3-7 years are shown to be different between the two periods and the two regions, but not different for the 2-year age-class which is affected less than the older age-classes by the fishing gear deployed in the fishery. (2) Avoiding the pitfalls of 'back-calculation', Rosa Lee's Phenomenon was detected by directly comparing the radii of growth-increment bands visible on the faces of the articular cups of vertebral centra from sharks of various ages caught in the two periods and the two regions. Statistical tests indicated that the degree of Rosa Lee's Phenomenon did not vary significantly between the periods or regions. (3) Through development of an appropriate model, the effects of length-selective fishing mortality oa the mean length of sharks in the wild population for age-classes 2-16 years were simulated for a range of levels of hook and gillnet fishing effort, with separate mesh-sizes of 6 and 7 in. for the gillnets. Simulated changes in mean length for sharks older than two years tended to be smaller than the differences observed in the published von Bertalanffy growth curves but they were generally consistent with the observed trends. The simulations demonstrated how the magnitude of the von Bertalanffy growth parameters L-infinity and t(0) tend to increase and K tends to decrease as gillnet fishing effort increases, and hence explain how these types of biases, commonly appearing in the scientific literature for gillnet shark fisheries, can occur. The simulations also demonstrate that hook fishing effort in a fishery with legal minimum lengths has to be very high to cause distortion of growth curves. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Refined and validated age and growth determinations are necessary for a proper understanding of tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) life history characteristics in the western North Atlantic (WNA). Age and growth estimates were derived from band counts of 238-sectioned vertebral centra. Bomb radiocarbon analysis of ten band pairs extracted from four vertebral sections suggested that band pairs are deposited annually up to age 20. Males and females were aged to 20 and 22\&nbsp;years, respectively, although longevity estimates predict maximum ages of 27 and 29\&nbsp;years, respectively. Two- and three-parameter von Bertalanffy and Gompertz growth functions fit to length at age data demonstrated that growth rates were similar for males and females up to around 200\&nbsp;cm fork length (FL) after which male growth slowed. Both sexes appear to reach maturity at age 10. The two-parameter von Bertalanffy growth function provided the best biological fit to length at age data generating parameter estimates of: L $\infty$ \&nbsp;=\&nbsp;330\&nbsp;cm FL, k\&nbsp;=\&nbsp;0.131 for males and L $\infty$ \&nbsp;=\&nbsp;347\&nbsp;cm FL, k\&nbsp;=\&nbsp;0.124 for females, with L 0 set at 62\&nbsp;cm FL. This study provides a rigorous description of tiger shark age and growth in the WNA and further demonstrates the utility of bomb radiocarbon as an age validation tool for elasmobranch fish.},

We serially demineralized vertebrae and compressively tested them to failure at varying strain rates. Mineral in vertebral cartilage varies within individuals, intraspecifically and interspecifically; this is in contrast to bone, in which significant variation in mineral content is pathological or an interspecific effect. Within Mustelus, vertebrae with larger mineral fractions were significantly stiffer and stronger; however when variation is assessed across species, the structure has a larger effect. Shark vertebral cartilage did not show a substantial viscoelastic response at biologically relevant strain rates, validating the use of quasistatic testing for this material.},

  abstract = {A relationship has not been established among models for yield per recruit analysis, models for demographic analysis, and age- and time-dependent models. Also, current models for-demographic analysis are number-based; biomass-based models have not been derived. Moreover, existing models for demographic analysis deal only with, females. The main difficulty in modelling the entire population lies in calculating the intrinsic rate of increase with time for males. Because males of dioecious species do not give birth to offspring, do they have an intrinsic rate of increase with time, at all? If so, is it zero? If not, what is it, and how can it be calculated? Without answering these questions, any sex-specific model for demographic analysis fails. In this paper, I establish an explicit relationship among models for yield per recruit analysis, models for demographic analysis, and age- and time-dependent models; develop workable sex-specific, number- and biomass-based models for demographic analysis by deriving formulae for calculating the intrinsic rate of increase with time for females, males, or both; show that Beverton and Holt's yield per recruit analysis is a special case of demographic analysis; and use models for demographic analysis and. models for yield per recruit analysis to analyse data on gummy shark Mustelus antarcticus in Bass Strait and school shark Galeorhinus galeus off southern Australia. Many quantities were computed for gummy and school sharks, including their intrinsic rates of increase with time; number- and biomass-based means and variances of the ages of females, males and both sexes in the population; and yield per recruit in number or in biomass, all as a function of the maximum instantaneous rate of fishing mortality of all those at all (total) lengths or ages q. Also computed were number- and biomass-based proportions of fish of a certain sex among all fish of that sex; those of fish among all fish in the population; and number- and biomass-based sex ratio, all as a function of age and q.

  doi = {10.1007/BF00394632},
  abstract = {Fish ages are often estimated by assuming an annual frequency of the band-like, growth-zones recorded in the largest of their otoliths, the sagittae. The total number of growth-zones are normally determined either by counting external growth-zones (whole otolith technique) or by examining otolith cross-sections (otolith section technique). The two techniques do not always yield the same age, however, particularly in older specimens of certain fishes. To resolve this problem, otoliths of the splitnose rockfish Sebastes diploproa were examined morphologically and were assayed for their natural radionuclide concentrations. Four age groups of otoliths were identified based on growth-zone counting; in the first three, whole otolith and otolith section age estimates agreed, while in the fourth, the otolith section age substantially exceeded the whole otolith age. Radiometric analysis demonstrated that all otoliths were deficient in 210Pb activity relative to 226Ra activity with the deficiency decreasing with increasing number of growth-zones. The magnitude of the 210Pb/226Ra radioactive disequilibrium in each otolith group, when compared to the number of growth-zones and the otolith weight histories derived with the two techniques, identifies the growth-zones revealed by otolith sections as annual features. Thus when otolith section age exceeds whole otolith age (usually occurring after 20 to 25 yr of age for this species), the otolith section technique is the correct method of age determination. Estimates of longevity in the genus Sebastes near 80 yr are therefore confirmed.},

In the 1950s--1960s, thermonuclear testing released large amounts of radiocarbon into the atmosphere, which diffused into the ocean through gas exchange. This influx created a time-specific marker that can be used in age validation. Annual band-pair deposition in the porbeagle, Lamna nasus, was validated in a previous study and indicated preliminary annual deposition in the shortfin mako, using four samples from one vertebra. In the present study, age estimates from 54 shortfin mako vertebrae collected in 1950--1984 ranged 1--31~years. Ageing error between readers was consistent, with 76\% of the estimates ranging within 2~years. Twenty-one $\Delta$14C values from eight shortfin mako vertebrae (collected in the western North Atlantic in 1963--1984) ranged -154.8texttenthousand to 86.8texttenthousand. The resulting conformity with the $\Delta$14C timeline for the porbeagle supported annual band-pair deposition in vertebrae of the shortfin mako.},

  abstract = {I explored the effect of uncertainty in demographic traits on demographic analyses of sharks, an approach not used before for this taxon. I used age-structured life tables and Leslie matrices based on a prebreeding survey and a yearly time step applied only to females to model the demography of 41 populations from 38 species of sharks representing four orders and nine families. I used Monte Carlo simulation to reflect uncertainty in the estimates of demographic traits and to calculate population statistics and elasticities for these populations; I used correlation analysis to identify the demographic traits that explained most of the variation in population growth rates (lambda). The populations I examined fell along a continuum of life-history characteristics that can be linked to elasticity patterns. Sharks characterized by early age at maturity, short lifespan, and large litter size had high lambda values and short generation times, whereas sharks that mature late and have long lifespans and small litters have low lambda values and long generation times. Sharks at the "fast" end of the spectrum tended to have comparable adult and juvenile survival elasticities, whereas sharks at the "slow" end of the continuum had high juvenile survival elasticity and low age-zero survival (or fertility) elasticity. Ratios of adult survival to fertility elasticities and juvenile survival to fertility elasticities suggest that many of the populations studied do not possess the biological attributes necessary to restore lambda to its original level after moderate levels of exploitation. Elasticity analysis suggests that changes in juvenile survival would have the greatest effect on lambda, and correlation analysis indicates that variation in juvenile survival, age at maturity, and reproduction account for most of the variation in lambda. In general, combined results from elasticity and correlation analyses suggest that research, conservation, and management efforts should focus on these demographic traits.},

Vertebrae and reproductive data collected from the virgin (1961-1966) and exploited (1993-2004) populations were analysed to test for differences in growth rate and age and length at maturity between the time periods. We detected significant differences between reparameterized von Bertalanffy growth models for each period, using likelihood ratio tests. Beyond an age of 7 years, mean length at age was greater during 1993-2004 than during 1961-1966. Between 1961-1963 and 1999-2001, length at maturity decreased in males (from 179 to 174 cm curved fork length (CFL)) and was invariant in females (216 cm CFL), whereas age at maturity declined in both males (from 8 to 7 years) and females (from 19 to 14 years). An analysis of porbeagle temperature associations indicated that sharks occupied comparable temperature conditions during the mid-1960s and 1990s, ruling out the possibility of temperature-induced growth changes. The observed increase in growth rate and decrease in age at maturity following exploitation support the hypothesis of a compensatory density-dependent growth response.},

To determine the periodicity with which growth increments are formed in the vertebrae of gummy shark, Mustelus antarcticus, fluorochrome dyes were injected into captive sharks at quarterly intervals. Variation in the vertebral growth rate between fluorochrome labels was examined and compared with measurements of the density of mineralisation of vertebral sections. The slowest rates of vertebral growth and the highest radiographic densities were found in the vertebral tissues formed during winter. The microradiographic method described here resolves individual hypermineralised increments that are indistinguishable using surface reading methods. With this extra information, a reader may better count, group, or exclude certain growth increment patterns when making an age estimation. Counts of clusters of hypermineralised increments may be more useful in age determination than counts of individual increments because individual increments form unpredictably and possibly result from brief, irregular episodes of slow vertebral growth.},

Recent long-term tag returns suggest that the sandbar shark grows much slower than previously proposed and may take nearly 30 yr to reach maturity.

In all, 502 winter (Leucoraja ocellata), little (Leucoraja erinacea), thorny (Amblyraja radiata), and smooth (Malacoraja senta) skate vertebral centra collected seasonally between 1999 and 2004 were sectioned using a mass processing method, then used to reconstruct growth in each species. Bomb rediocarbon (Delta C-14) analysis was used to provide evidence of annual band-pair deposition in thorny skates. Estimates of L-infinity from traditional von Bertalanffy growth models (VBGM) ranged from 60.6 cm (little skate) to 89.7 cm (thorny skate), and K estimates from 0.07 (thorny skate) to 0.19 (little skate). A modified two-parameter VBGM (L-MAX = 94.1 cm) fitted to winter skate lenght-at-age data yielded a value of K to 0.15. Maximum observed ages ranged from 12 (little skate) to 19 years in both winter and thorny skates. The year-specific incorporation of Delta C-14 milled from thorny and winter skate vertebral sections closely resembled shark-derived reference chronology values from the Northwest Atlantic. Pre-bomb Delta C-14 in a thorny skate collected in 1988 and aged at 23 years appeared to validate age interpretations and suggested that thorny skate reach an absolute age of at least 28 years, the oldest validated age reported for any species of batoid.},

  abstract = {The sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus)was the cornerstone species of western North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico large coastal shark fisheries until 2008 when they were allocated to a research-only fishery. Despite decades of fishing on this species, important life history parameters, such as age and growth, have not been well known. Some validated age and growth information exists for sandbar shark, but more comprehensive life history information is needed. The complementary application of bomb radiocarbon and tag-recapture dating was used in this study to determine valid age-estimation criteria and longevity estimates for this species. These two methods indicated that current age interpretations based on counts of growth bands in vertebrae are accurate to 10 or 12 years. Beyond these years, we could not determine with certainty when such an underestimation of age begins; however, bomb radiocarbon and tag-recapture data indicated that large adult sharks were considerably older than the estimates derived from counts of growth bands. Three adult sandbar sharks were 20 to 26 years old based on bomb radiocarbon results and were a 5- to 11-year increase over the previous age estimates for these sharks. In support of these findings, the tag-recapture data provided results that were consistent with bomb radiocarbon dating and further supported a longevity that exceeds 30 years for this species.},

  abstract = {The decline and disappearance of species from large parts of their former geographical ran-e has become an important issue in fisheries ecology. There is a need to identify which species are at risk of extinction. The available approaches have been subject to considerable debate - particularly when applied to commercially exploited species. Here we have compiled methods that have been used or may be used for assessing threat status of marine organisms. We organize the methods according to the availability of data on the natural history, ecology and population biology of species. There are three general approaches to inferring or assessing extinction risk: (i) correlative approaches based on knowledge of life histories and ecology: (ii) time-series approaches that examine changes in abundance: and (iii) demographic approaches based on age- or stage-based schedules of vital rates and fisheries reference points. Many methods are well suited to species that are highly catchable and/or have relatively low productivity, but theory is less well developed for assessing extinction risk in species exhibiting narrow geographical distributions or ecological specialization. There is considerable variation in both definitions of extinction risk and the precision and defensibility of the available risk assessment methods, so we suggest a two-tiered approach for defining and assessing extinction risk. First. simple methods requiring a few easily estimated parameters are used to triage or rapidly assess large numbers of populations and species to identify potentially vulnerable populations or species. Second. the populations and species identified as vulnerable by this process can then be subject to more detailed and rigorous population analysis explicitly considering sources of error and uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Age-length data were derived from counting stained bands on whole vertebral centra obtained from gummy shark, Mustelus antarcticus, captured by gill-nets during 1973-76 in Bass Strait and from gummy shark and school shark, Galeorhinus galeus, captured during 1986-87 in Bass Strait and waters off South Australia. The data were fitted to the von Bertalanffy growth equation after adopting the Francis reparametrization and correcting for sampling bias caused by the selectivity effects of the gill-nets of various mesh sizes used to capture the sharks. The von Bertalanffy growth curves of male and female gummy shark were significantly different, but the growth curves of male and female school shark were not. The growth curves suggest that growth rates of male and female gummy shark in Bass Strait were lower during 1986-87 than during 1973-76 and that the growth rates of male and female gummy shark and school shark in Bass Strait during 1986-87 were lower than those in South Australia at the same time. These apparent temporal and spatial differences in growth patterns of gummy shark are explained by the 'Phenomenon of Apparent Change in Growth Rate'. It is concluded that the growth curves determined for 1986-87 are distorted by the effects of a long history of high and length-selective fishing mortality and that actual growth patterns of gummy shark are better represented by the von Bertalanffy growth equation determined for shark caught in Bass Strait during 1973-76, when fishing mortality was much lower. Verification of age estimates was attempted by comparing von Bertalanffy growth curves derived from age-length data with those derived from tag release-recapture length-increment data, but these comparisons highlight the limitations of using tag data for this purpose. Although reasonable agreement was found between such growth curves for gummy shark, it appears that school shark older than 11 years cannot be aged accurately from stained whole or sectioned vertebrae. Sectioned vertebrae from a school shark recaptured 35.7 years after being tagged and released and calculated as having an age exceeding 45 years gave estimates of only 18-20 years of age.},

  abstract = {Marine ecosystems are suffering severe depletion of apex predators worldwide [1-4]; shark declines are principally due to conservative life-histories and fisheries overexploitation [5-8]. On coral reefs, sharks are strongly interacting apex predators and play a key role in maintaining healthy reef ecosystems [911]. Despite increasing fishing pressure, reef shark catches are rarely subject to specific limits, with management approaches typically depending upon no-take marine reserves to maintain populations [12-14]. Here, we reveal that this approach is failing by documenting an ongoing collapse in two of the most abundant reef shark species on the Great Barrier Reef (Australia). We find an order of magnitude fewer sharks on fished reefs compared to no-entry management zones that encompass only 1\% of reefs. No-take zones, which are more difficult to enforce than no-entry zones, offer almost no protection for shark populations. Population viability models of whitetip and gray reef sharks project ongoing steep declines in abundance of 7\% and 17\% per annum, respectively. These findings indicate that current management of no-take areas is inadequate for protecting reef sharks, even in one of the world's most-well-managed reef ecosystems. Further steps are urgently required for protecting this critical functional group from ecological extinction.},

Maximum age estimates of 13 and 10 years were obtained from female (n = 76) and male (n = 44) N. kuhlii, respectively. Estimated ages at maturity for 50\% of females and males were 6.32 and 3.95 years, respectively. A three-parameter power function provided the best statistical fit to size at age data in both sexes, providing parameter estimates of y(0) = 163.13, a = 58.52 and b = 0.58 for females and y(0) = 165.13, a = 59.02 and b = 0.54 in males. The two-parameter von Bertalanffy growth function was used to estimate biological parameters based on disc width (W-D) for both female (W-D infinity = 465.81 mm, K = 0.13 year(-1), b = 0.63) and male N. kuhlii (W-D infinity = 385.19 mm, K = 0.20 year(-1), b = 0.54). Annual band-pair deposition was observed in three calcein-injected N. kuhlii after periods of liberty ranging from 631 to 1081 days. Centrum edge analysis indicated that annual band-pair formation was generally consistent within this population, with translucent bands formed over spring and summer and opaque bands formed in autumn and winter. Individual growth rates obtained from tagged specimens were similar to power function growth predictions. These results support previous characterizations of this common trawl by-catch species as comparatively resilient to non-targeted catches, although higher catch rates outside Australia infer a need for cautious management.

Eastern North Pacific female and male salmon sharks were aged up to 20 and 17 years, respectively. Relative marginal increment (RMI) analysis showed that postnatal rings form annually between January and March. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters derived from vertebral length-at-age data are L-proportional to=207.4 cm PCL, k=0.17/yr, and t(0)=-2.3 years for females (n=166), and L-proportional to=182.8 cm PCL, k=0.23/yr, and t(0)=-1.9 years for males (n=16). Age at maturity was estimated to range from six to nine years for females (median precaudal length of 164.7 cm PCL) and from three to five years old for males (median precaudal length of 124.0 cm PCL). Weight-length relationships for females and males in the eastern North Pacific are W= 8.2 x 10-(05) x L-2.759 (r(2)=0.99) and W=3.2x 10(-06) x L-3.383 (r2=0.99), respectively.

Offspring size correlated negatively with growth completion rate (K), but the correlation
became positive after correcting for the effects of body size. Parental size for males and
females was negatively correlated with K. Parental size and size at maturity exhibited a strong
positive correlation, with sexual maturity occurring at about \textbf{\emph{75\% }}of maximum size in both
sexes. Males were \textbf{\emph{10\% }}smaller than females and reached their maximum length \textbf{\emph{34\% }}faster
than females on average. Females tend to mature later and live longer than males, but age
at maturity is reached at about \textbf{\emph{50\% }}of maximum age in both sexes. Maximum size and
empirical longevity were not significantly correlated in females, but were positively correlated
in males. Size and age at maturity also exhibited a moderate positive correlation in males,
especially after excluding data for \textbf{\emph{Squalus acanthius. }}Principal component and cluster
analyses were used to reflect similarities among life history traits of \textbf{\emph{40 }}populations from \textbf{\emph{34
}}species, and \textbf{at }least three separate life history strategies were identified.\textbf{\emph{

  abstract = {The rapid expansion of human activities threatens ocean-wide biodiversity. Numerous marine animal populations have declined, yet it remains unclear whether these trends are symptomatic of a chronic accumulation of global marine extinction risk. We present the first systematic analysis of threat for a globally distributed lineage of 1,041 chondrichthyan fishes\textemdash{}sharks, rays, and chimaeras. We estimate that one-quarter are threatened according to IUCN Red List criteria due to overfishing (targeted and incidental). Large-bodied, shallow-water species are at greatest risk and five out of the seven most threatened families are rays. Overall chondrichthyan extinction risk is substantially higher than for most other vertebrates, and only one-third of species are considered safe. Population depletion has occurred throughout the world's ice-free waters, but is particularly prevalent in the Indo-Pacific Biodiversity Triangle and Mediterranean Sea. Improved management of fisheries and trade is urgently needed to avoid extinctions and promote population recovery.},
